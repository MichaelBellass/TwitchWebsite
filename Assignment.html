    <h1>ASSIGNMENT</h1>
    <h2>UNIT 1 - OUTCOME 1</h2>
    
    <div class=assignmenttxt >
    <p><b>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</b><br>
    <br>
  <p>  1.1	A crucial aspect of using IT in modern business is being able to implement various online features. Many businesses are only available online which helps to reach a wider market by using websites that showcase business information, merchandise, and delivery. With a business being online it helps to simplify business updates, the services they offer and using free social media apps to help promote the business. <br></p>
    <br>
     1.2 <b>Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects 
    successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What 
    skills?</b> <br>
    <br>
    1.2	Trello is a useful tool to help keep track of progression. You can create and assign multiple tasks and organize them into “To do” “doing” and “completed” sections on the board. This is helpful if working in teams as each team member can be given the option to edit the Trello board, updating the rest of the team on completed or any outstanding tasks. In terms of coding and digital projects tasks can be completed using the VSC (visual Studio Code). <br>
    <br>   

    <div><b>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? 
    Include a link to your Trello board. </b><br>
    <br>
    
    1.3	You can plan using Trello. It allows you to create cards in which you can write text. You can use a step by step structure using the cards picking the tasks to be completed and even color code the cards to highlight highest and lowest priority tasks. <br>

<br>
    <div><b>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital 
    projects to fail? Why? </b><br>
    <br>
    1.4	Sometimes technology can let us down. The internet connection can be disrupted, a computer could crash and you lose all your work and even hackers can try to steal and manipulate projects. Servers needed for digital projects could also be down halting your project progression.<br>

  <div> <b><br>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – 
    how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? </b><br>
    <br>
    1.5	There is a variety of websites which offer a free service to help make websites such wix.com and square space.  Others offer a monthly subscription service which allows to use more premium content to help make your website more to what you desire. Visual studio code is also free software, which is handy for businesses with limited budget. <br>
    <br>

    <div><b>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you 
    achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and 
    GitHub help with your codes version control </b><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    1.6	In previous projects such as creating a text based game I was able to utilize Microsoft word in creating the narrative for the game and VSC in completing the coding. I also made use of websites such as w3schools.com to help implement different coding techniques. Trello was used as a base for planning and assigning tasks to me completed, keeping this up to date regularly helped the flow of the completion process.  Using the diagrams.net application was useful in laying out the overall structure of the game, giving indication of narrative placement, character interactions, decision making and outcomes. <br>
    <br>

    <div><b>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does 
    GDPR impact digital projects? </b><br>
    <br>
    1.7	GDPR is put in place to protect privacy and data protection to all individual citizens in Europe. In creating a website a guide is put in place to help keep business owners compliant with these regulations. They range from Identifying the business, the right of users to grant consent to use data, company policies and procedures, consumer protection, accessibility, cyber security and respecting copyright laws.

    <h2>UNIT 1 - OUTCOME 2</h2>
    <br>
    <div><b> Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – 
      in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello </b> <br>
    <br>
    In making the website I have had to refer to resources such as w3 schools, 
    google and YouTube tutorials in help with getting the website to look how I want. I would use these especially
     if I was struggling on a particular matter, and I put into practice what I learn. 
     VSC is a great resource in which It can only work if the information is correct, 
     if not you are prompted by the program and directed to the area of issue.
      It helps in guiding you to the next steps to try and resolve the problem. <br>
    <br>
    <div><b>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</b></div> <br>
    <br>
    VSC I felt was a very appropriate tool for the design of a website. There are many other software programs you could use, but Visual Studio Codes software layout and use of different colours letting you know what action you are about to perform makes for a smoother process. Using slack and the w3 school’s website were helpful for me to use as a base for whenever I struggled with codes.
     The uploads of the videos posted in slack of our tutorials really helped me to remember what we have learned. <br>
     <br>
     <div><b>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website?
        Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness.
         What would you change?</b></div> <br>
         <br>
         Overall, I am happy with the website I have created. Given more time there is room for improvements. I wanted to focus on getting the website working, using links, image links, inserting images and text, navigating links to other pages on the website and getting a background.
        Once I managed to do this and get everything in place in gave me more opportunity to make the website look more tasteful by testing out different colours and fonts. I even managed to put videos onto the website which was fun for me to research and implement. 
        I would like to have added a side bar of some sorts to make navigation of the website easier for the viewer.
         There is a lot of colour used in the website so one of the challenges was to have any text readable.
         I would have maybe changed the entire colour scheme to something a little bit plainer as I believe it would have been easier to structure and read the website content.  <br>
         <br>
      <div><b>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</b></div> <br>
      <br>
      There are parts of the website which needed work, such as the logo image on the index page left unwanted links at the bottom of the logo.  I believe it had something to do with the margins or padding.
       I wanted to add more text to the games I streamed and upcoming streams pages. 
       I would have liked to talk about my experience playing these games in more detail. 
       I would like to further improve the overall layout and structure of the website using different colour schemes and font to give it more of a cohesive look. <br>
       <br>

       <h2>Unit 1, Outcome 3 (Review)</h2><br>
       <br>
      
       <div><b> 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – 
         could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</b></div> <br>
         <br>
         I could have used Trello to be more organised by creating more tasks and giving more of a step by step on what I needed to complete. 
         I could have made use of favouriting websites to avoid me having to use google search for a particular code, also just organisation of what’s on my monitor and implementing split screen could have helped me to see what I was doing more clearly. I do believe the making of a website could done as a team. The Trello board can help with this by assigning tasks to different team members 
         i.e. Each member is given a page of the website to code and link to other pages. <br>
         <br>
         <div><b>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</b></div> <br>
         <br>
         Having a favourites list of websites to look back on if struggling with any HTML/CSS issues.
          Making use of the notepad to input particular codes that you might use more often than others. 
         Using Trello to its full potential, organizing tasks and keeping up to date the what still needs to be completed. <br>
         <br>
         <div><b>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</b></div> <br>
         <br>
         If an opportunity to create another website came up with an option to work in teams I believe that would be more effective than doing the work solo. Being able to split off different tasks for others to work on gives you more time to concentrate and what is being asked of you. Using slack and Trello as means of communication can help to improve productivity by informing others of what stage you are at in your task. It helps especially for those who are finding difficulties in their given task,
          as they can reach out on slack and ask for some guidance thus increasing productivity to get the website complete. <br>
          <br>
          <div><b>• 3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions </b></div> <br>
          <br>
          In VSC you can create and test your coding by loading the index page of your HTML online. It is a good tool to help keep track of your progress by giving you a visual of how your website is coming together.
          I would practice writing codes from various resources from websites and online tutorials to test and see how it would look on my website. <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>UNIT 2 - OUTCOME 1</h2> <br>
          <br>
        
          <div><b>1.1	Describing the content and layout for each page</b></div> <br>
          <br>
          On the main page you are introduced to a brief description of myself and what the website is about. The logo I created is a clickable image directing you to my Twitch page. The “Streamed Games” page gives you information on games that I have played previously along with a brief description and my personal thoughts. “upcoming streams” page is set out as a schedule letting you know what games I will be playing in the future with a set date and time. The “socials” pages give you an image link to my Instagram page for those who wish to contact me outside of the website. And finally, 
          my “highlights” page showcases short videos of memorable gaming moments to give the viewer an idea of games I play. <br>
          <br>
  <div><b>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites.</b></div> <br>
  <br>
  When creating a website it is a general rule that anything you wish to put on there should be assumed to be protected. If any content provided on your website doesn’t belong to you it is best to reach to the original owner of the content to avoid unauthorised content and law suits.
Content such as images used on websites that can be found on other 3rd party websites can easily be mistaken to be “royal” or “copyright” free. This is when you would need to read the click-wrap agreement which is often overlooked to specify intended uses.
If you should be in a situation where a complaint has been made against you on unauthorised materials on your website, first and foremost it is best to remove this material. Even if you feel it appropriate, its best to consult with a lawyer to discuss fair use of the material.

Unauthorised use of material can interrupt workflow and completion of any website projects causing failure to meet specific deadlines. Unless you are using material that you can for certain claim as your own, it is always best to do the research and seek out the original owner’s permission before making your website public. The internet is constantly updating, and businesses are very protective of content they make. 
It is much easier these days for website creators to be caught using someone else’s content. So, when in doubt always seek permission. <br>
<br>
<div><b>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - 
  describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</b></div> <br>
  <br>
  A website is going to be accessed by all so it’s important to make any necessary alterations for those with a disability. This includes <br>

-	Use of Font sizes <br>
A clear and well structured website with a large readable font for those who are visually impaired. <br>
-	Colour Scheme <br>
Making correct use of colours, ensuring backgrounds and font colours are not too bright or harsh and make it difficult for the user to read. <br>
-	Using subtitles in videos <br>
Websites such as YouTube will heavily implement this to appeal to all audiences. The use of a transcript in videos is a helpful resource for users. <br>
-	Appropriate use of periods in abbreviations <br>
For those who are using “screen read” on their systems, appropriate language and use of abbreviations can help the user to transcribe what is being read. <br>
-	A simple and cohesive website. <br>

Keeping a simple layout for a website will help to keep it more organised in general. Using correct spacing between content, accessible descriptive links and clear texts are helpful.
<br>
<br>
<div><b>1.8	Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites</b></div> <br>
<br>
In terms of images the basic formats used are: <br>
-	JPG, JPEG, GIF, PNG <br>
There’s also files types used for video and music files <br>
-	Video – AVI, MOV <br>
-	Music/sounds  – MIDI, MP3, WAV <br>
<br>
And of course a file type that is used to create a website including the different pages of the website is all HTML/CSS Based. <br>
